# Unforced.org — Website Design Specification

## Overview

**Site Purpose:** A personal hub for Aaron G Neyer — a simple, intimate signpost that points to who he is and what he's bringing forth in the world.

**Core Feel:** Joyous, light, deep, connected. Like flowing water and effortless growth. Minimal but personal. Not a library or portfolio — a mirror and an invitation.

**Tagline/Subhead:** "Exploring what it means to live well and developing systems in support of it."

**Design Direction:** Clean, spacious, nature-inspired. Think: morning light, flowing water, mountain stillness. The design should breathe. White space is welcome. The site should feel like Aaron — warm, curious, grounded, alive.

2. **Who I Am** — Story, lineage, path
3. **What Unforced Means** — The philosophy

## Section 1: Opening

The first thing visitors see. Should capture essence before content.

### Content

**Name:** Aaron G Neyer

**Word:** Unforced

**Opening Line (choose one or test variations):**
- "Life is far more meaningful when we understand ourselves and participate."
- "Exploring what it means to live well and developing systems in support of it."

**Visual Direction:** Could include subtle imagery of water, mountains, or morning light. Keep it spacious and inviting.

---

## Section 2: Who I Am

The story — lineage, places, path. Personal but not a resume. Written in first person, conversational.

### Content

> I'm Aaron G. I'm a dancer, a builder, a communicator. I love living and I love connecting, and I feel inspired to live as fully as I can.
>
> I was born to two amazing parents, Joe and Becky. They gave me a beautiful life and a beautiful foundation. I've lost both of them to cancer, and so that in many ways motivates me to live for all of us. I feel like I carry three lives in one body.
>
> My dad Joe gave me the word *Unforced*. He was a Tai Ji teacher and a builder of houses — a man with a great eye for angles and aesthetics and for living well. He wrote a book called *Too Much Fun Dying to Stop Now* while living with terminal brain cancer, and in it he pointed again and again to this way of being: that things unfold in their own time, unforced. My mom Becky was a math teacher and a deep lover of the earth and of gardens. I am very much their son.
>
> I live in Boulder, Colorado. The mountains are my home now, though my roots stretch back through Ohio and Oregon — college towns, academic spaces, places where curiosity is welcome. I have a background in computer science from Case Western, a master's in Ecopsychology from Naropa, and I'm finishing a master's in Creative Technology & Design at CU Boulder.

**Optional Addition — On His Name:**

> A bit about my name: Aaron means "mountain of strength" and Gabriel means "God is my strength." I also carry a connection to eastern traditions through the name Hanuran Surya — "joyous breath shining like the sun." I sometimes think of Aaron as "Air-In," emphasizing my connection to the breath. These symbols connect me to myself and to the world around me.

**Link:** When Joe is mentioned, link to the essay "Happy Birthday Joe" on Substack (https://unforced.substack.com/p/happy-birthday-joe)

## Section 3: What Unforced Means

The philosophy. Brief on the main page, with depth available through links.

### Content

> Unforced is about being in harmony with life and with nature. It's about listening to the way nature moves and attuning to that. It's about recognizing that we're a part of nature — so when we harmonize ourselves with nature, we're also listening to our own nature.
>
> Unforced is about understanding who we are so that we can be our natural expression. It's not about being passive and just letting it all happen. The Taoists call it *wu-wei* — not forcing.
>
> My dad lived it. He met cancer, met death, met each day with a kind of radical acceptance and presence. As he wrote: "Unforced was your word and unforced was your way. As a student of tai chi and a student of nature, you discovered the effortless spontaneity of the natural world and of your own nature."
>
> What I've come to understand is that this isn't just a personal philosophy — it's how living systems actually work. Self-organizing networks don't push the river. Life unfolds through relationship, through connection, through participating with what's already moving. When we stop forcing, we start belonging.

**Closing Touchstone (optional, could be displayed as a design element):**

> "Live to Grow, Grow to Love." — Joe Neyer

**Link:** Could link to a deeper essay on Substack about the philosophy (e.g., "Weaving Wu-Wei" at https://unforced.substack.com/p/weaving-wu-wei)

## Section 4: What I'm Bringing Forth

The living projects. Each gets a short description rooted in *why* it exists, plus a link.

### Content

**Parachute**
> Parachute exists because our thinking is fragmented. The fragmentation in our tools is affecting the fragmentation in our thinking. I've spent ten years searching for a tool that actually helps me think — and now I'm building it. Parachute is open, local-first, voice-first extended mind technology. A connected tool for connected thinking.
>
> → [Link to Parachute site or more info]

**Woven Web**
> Woven Web exists because we need to find new ways of being together. It's a communal learning lab exploring what it means to be alive together — holding deep curiosity in consciousness, connectedness, and communication. We don't claim to have the answers. We're finding them together.
>
> → [Link to wovenweb.org]

**What Technology Can Be**
> A media project exploring a different relationship with technology — looking at new technologies that actually contribute to living a more balanced life. It's about recognizing that technology emerges from our human aliveness and can enrich our experience when we understand it as part of who we are.
>
> → [Link when ready]

**Tai Ji**
> I'm a student of Tai Ji, and occasionally a teacher of it. This practice connects me to embodiment and flow, and to my dad who first taught me to dance this way. I study with Chungliang Al Huang and practice with my stepmom Laurie, continuing a lineage of movement and presence.

**Unforced Development**
> *Coming soon* — an organization devoted to supporting the emergence of what wants to be born.

**Link Opportunity:** The "What Technology Can Be" section could link to the essay "Growing Technology, Boulder and Beyond" (https://unforced.substack.com/p/growing-technology-boulder-and-beyond) as deeper context.

These quotes from Aaron's writing can be used as design elements, pull quotes, or section accents:

**On Unforced:**
> "Unforced was your word and unforced was your way."

**On Balance:**
> "A balanced view recognizes that technology can be useful, but that it's important to be attentive to the distortions that come with it, and to use it intentionally."

**On Inheritance:**
> "My life is not my life alone. My life is an extension of yours, and mom's as well."

**On Writing:**
> "I find that most of my favorite writing comes from a long walk and using my voice, sometimes dictating into a phone and sometimes talking with a friend."

**Joe's Touchstone:**
