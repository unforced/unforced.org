If you’ve been reading along here, you know I’ve been [building in the margins](https://unforced.substack.com/p/building-in-the-margins) lately. Small projects emerging from conversations. Ideas becoming real in days instead of months.

That shift — from “I should build that someday” to “let me just... build it” — is what I want to share.

## What is Learn Vibe Build?

A 4-week cohort for people who want to create things using AI as a collaborator.

Not a bootcamp. Not tutorials you watch alone. It’s a container — 25 people learning together, building alongside each other, figuring this out in real time.

### What you might create:

-  A website for your creative work or business
-  A newsletter system or content practice
-  A tool that helps you organize something in your life
-  Something for your community
-  An idea you’ve been carrying but didn’t know how to make real

The point isn’t to become a developer, unless you want to. It’s to close the gap between vision and artifact. To experience what it feels like when the bottleneck shifts from “can I build this?” to “what do I actually want?”

### How it works:

-  Starts January 20, runs 4 weeks
-  Live sessions Tuesdays at 6pm MST
-  Office hours throughout the week for hands-on support
-  Primarily virtual, but hybrid for Boulder folks — in-person option at Regen Hub for most sessions
-  Culminates with demo day on February 13, where you share what you made

**$100** (scholarships available) + Claude Pro ($20/month).

## What’s next

This cohort feeds into [ETHBoulder](https://ethboulder.com/) (Feb 13-15), where we’re creating Vibe Central — an emergent space for building with AI during the hackathon. Go through Learn Vibe Build, and you arrive ready to create.

Miss this round? There’ll be a condensed version during ETHBoulder, and another full cohort after.

We’re building toward something ongoing — an AI learning community, here in Boulder and virtually. This is the beginning of that.

## The invitation

**Applications close tomorrow (Monday, January 19).**

If you know someone it’d be perfect for, send it their way. We still have spots.
