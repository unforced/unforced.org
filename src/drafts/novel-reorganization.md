*A mentor of mine likes to say: any meaningful disturbance leads to either a collapse or a novel reorganization.*

*What follows is speculative fiction — but only barely. The seeds described here are already in the ground.*

## I. The Fall (2027)

The economists called it a structural adjustment. The people living through it called it something else.

It came faster than the models predicted, though the signals had been there for years. By mid-2027, the weekly unemployment numbers had become an event — people gathering around phones in offices that were themselves half-empty, watching the claims tick upward. Not factory workers this time. Software engineers in their thirties. Analysts. Lawyers who had spent three years in school to do work that machine intelligence could now do in seconds. The companies didn't act out of malice. The math just stopped working. If a system costing a few hundred dollars a month could replace a team of twelve knowledge workers, the market demanded it. And so it happened.

Then the market that demanded it began to break.

The knowledge workers who'd been replaced had mortgages. The mortgages were held by banks whose entire architecture assumed that knowledge work would remain scarce and therefore valuable. The assumption became false, and the architecture that rested on it buckled — not all at once, but with a logic that felt almost mechanical once you saw it. Consumer demand fell. Private credit markets froze. Companies that had bet on the new order found themselves caught in its undertow alongside everyone else.

Grief is the right word for what it felt like from the inside. Not the panic of a sudden crash but something slower — the particular grief of watching something you'd organized your life around reveal that it had been resting on sand. That your intelligence, your education, your skill, the thing you'd traded decades of your life to develop, had quietly become abundant. And therefore cheap. And therefore replaceable.

The disturbance was real. The losses were real. It would be dishonest to tell a story about what came next without saying that first.

But a disturbance is not a destiny. What comes after it — whether collapse or something else — depends on what's already in the ground.

## II. Boulder, Spring 2028

Regen Hub hadn't closed its doors once during the fall.

Kevin had kept the coffee going and stopped asking people why they were there. They arrived with laptops under their arms and that particular look of someone who has recently had the ground shift beneath them. A UX designer whose entire agency had folded in six weeks. A data scientist who'd spent eight years building the models that had made his own position redundant. A former ML engineer, three months out of work, who'd been meaning to come to one of these gatherings for two years and had kept putting it off because she was always too busy.

They knew how to build things. They just no longer had anywhere to sell what they could build.

So they started building for here.

It began with small problems. The mutual aid food network covering five Boulder neighborhoods had been running on a patchwork of spreadsheets and group texts for three years — it worked, barely. Within a week of that former engineer showing up at a coordination meeting, it had a tool. Nothing fancy. Just something that let the network see itself: who had surplus, who had need, where the gaps were. She built it in a weekend. It was forked and adapted in Denver, then Fort Collins, then six cities she'd never visited. She hadn't asked permission to share it. Nobody asked permission to use it.

Maggie Appleton calls this figure the *barefoot developer* — borrowing from the barefoot doctors of rural China, community health workers trained well enough to serve their people, not credentialed enough for the hospital. As machine intelligence had lowered the floor on what building required, a generation of people found themselves with enough skill and suddenly available time, oriented not toward the market but toward the people in front of them. The concept of the software professional, the knowledge worker whose labor was a commodity to be sold — that figure was dissolving. What was crystallizing in its place was something older and more local: the person in the community who knows how to make useful things and makes them for the community.

EthBoulder had felt like a small signal of this even before the fall — a few hundred people in Boulder's orbit who believed that the tools being built could serve something other than speculation. After the fall, that signal got louder. The winter gathering at Regen Hub was standing room, spilling into the hallway. Not because anything had mooned. Because people needed to coordinate, and some of those people knew how to build coordination tools, and those tools had suddenly become urgent.

Someone who had been working on governance questions for years said something that kept circulating afterward: *Humans write a readable constitution in natural language. MI interprets its spirit.* Not machine intelligence as the governor — as the servant of human-written values. The mutual aid network's tool didn't decide who got food. It made visible what the community had already decided mattered. The distinction felt subtle until you lived it, and then it felt like everything.

The Front Range was figuring something out. Slowly, imperfectly, with too much coffee and longer meetings than anyone wanted. But something was being built here that hadn't been possible before, because the people who knew how to build the infrastructure of belonging had finally stopped building for someone else.

## III. Cascadia, Summer 2028

The Columbia River doesn't care about state lines.

The watershed council had been meeting for eleven years — a loose confederation of Indigenous water stewards, city planners from Portland and Vancouver, farmers from the Willamette Valley, salmon biologists, a few stubborn municipal engineers who believed in something called the commons. They'd accomplished real things over those years. They'd also spent a lot of time in rooms arguing about process.

What changed in the summer of 2028 wasn't the relationships. Those had been built over years of hard, patient work, and no crisis could substitute for them. What changed was the infrastructure those relationships could now run on.

They called it the commons layer — an MI system trained on the council's accumulated knowledge, their meeting notes and agreements and disputes and resolutions, and on something the council had written together over several months the year before: a natural language constitution. Not a legal document. More like a living record of what they believed. What this watershed is. What they owe each other. What they owe the river. Specific enough to mean something. Open enough to breathe.

The MI didn't govern. It remembered. It helped a Yakama water rights negotiator surface a precedent from six years prior during a meeting with Portland's utility department. It helped a Willamette Valley farmer understand how a land management decision upstream in British Columbia might affect her water table by June. It helped the council see the patterns in its own history — the agreements that had held, the ones that had frayed, the conditions under which trust had been built or broken.

Cascadia had been dreaming about bioregional governance for decades. The dream had always outrun the infrastructure. Now, piece by piece, the infrastructure was arriving.

The work was not smooth. There were serious, necessary conflicts about data sovereignty — who owned the commons layer, who could access it, what it could and couldn't be asked to do. The Indigenous members of the council had been through this before: well-intentioned technology that claimed to serve everyone while quietly encoding the values of whoever had built it. Those conversations were hard and slow and couldn't be rushed. They needed to be had.

But the council kept meeting. The river kept flowing. And something that looked, from a certain angle, like a functioning bioregional polity was assembling itself — not from the top down but from the accumulated weight of eleven years of relationship and one summer of finally having tools adequate to the task.

## IV. Asheville, Fall 2028

The mountains had always meant something different here.

Asheville had been practicing for this without knowing it. The culture that had grown up in the Blue Ridge over the past two decades had been quietly building muscles that were now being asked to carry weight. The craft economy. The community land trusts. The deep tradition of Appalachian mutual aid that predated any app. The arts community that had never fully subscribed to the growth-at-all-costs logic of the coastal cities.

These weren't just aesthetic preferences. They were, it turned out, adaptive structures.

When the displaced began arriving from Charlotte, Atlanta, the Research Triangle where the knowledge economy had concentrated itself, Asheville was not unaffected. Resources stretched. The question of who belonged here became tense in ways it hadn't been before. There was grief in this place too, and not everyone's grief looked the same.

A woman named Della, who'd run a community garden on the east side for nine years, said something at a neighborhood meeting that got shared around: *The roots were already here. What we're doing now is asking people to find them.*

It wasn't easy. Some of the newcomers wanted to optimize their way out of the crisis — to build apps that would scale nationally, to treat Asheville as a launchpad rather than a home. The community had to develop a kind of discernment: not gatekeeping, but asking honestly — are you here to extract, or here to belong? Those were uncomfortable conversations. They happened anyway.

The ones who stayed and sat with that question often became the most generative members of the community. Not despite having fallen, but because of it. The fall had stripped something away — the story that the machine economy would eventually deliver meaning, that optimization was a path to flourishing, that the good life was downstream of sufficient productivity. What was left, once that story dissolved, was a person looking for something real.

Asheville's thread in the cosmolocal network felt different from Boulder's and Portland's. Less technical, more human. More grief still present. But grief, it turned out, was a form of honesty. And honesty was the foundation everything else had to be built on.

## V. The Signal Fire, Winter 2028

It wasn't called a conference.

Conferences had agendas and keynotes and sponsors. This was something else — a distributed gathering, some people in rooms together, many on a call, some contributing asynchronously through the knowledge commons that had been slowly accumulating across the network over the preceding year. A hundred and fifty nodes: Boulder, Portland, Vancouver, the Southern Appalachians, a cooperative in Medellín where community currencies had been running for fifteen years, a digital democracy organization in Taiwan that had survived multiple stress tests, small towns in North Carolina's Piedmont that nobody had thought of as cosmolocal hubs until the fall made visible what had been quietly growing there.

Nobody was in charge. That was the point.

What they shared wasn't a plan. You can't plan a reorganization — you can only create the conditions for one and stay in relationship with what's emerging. What they shared were patterns. *This is what worked. This is what failed and why. This is the tool we built — here's the code, fork it if it's useful.*

The barefoot developer in Boulder who'd built the mutual aid coordination tool: forty-three forks now, across seven countries, each adapted to local context. She'd never met most of the people who'd used what she made. They'd never asked her permission.

Someone shared the watershed council's natural language constitution — not as a template to copy, but as evidence that the practice was possible. Seven other groups had started writing their own.

What emerged from the gathering wasn't a plan or a manifesto. It was a clearer sense of the pattern — all these local threads, oriented in the same direction without anyone directing them, held together not by a central authority but by a shared question.

*You belong to more places than you have names for.* That was a phrase circulating that winter, from Benjamin Life's writing on the infrastructure of belonging. People had been placing it above doorways, into email signatures, into the headers of coordination documents.

The gathering lasted three days. Most of it happened in small rooms and side conversations. The signal fire wasn't dramatic — it was more like the moment a murmuration of starlings shifts direction, and you realize all at once that something is coordinating without a conductor.

## VI. Coda

The reorganization wasn't finished. It might never be — that's the nature of living systems, which don't reach a final state so much as they continue to evolve in relationship with their environment.

The fall was real, and the losses were real, and the work of healing was long. Some communities found the disturbance unnavigable and collapsed. Not every thread of the network held. The grief didn't disappear — it became something different, something that could be worked with, which is not the same as resolution.

But in enough places, a different question had become audible. Quietly at first, then less quietly.

*What does this place need that I can make?*

That question had always been available. It had just been crowded out by louder questions — about competition, about survival, about capturing value before someone else did. The disturbance had stripped the noise away. Not as a gift. As a consequence. But consequence and gift sometimes arrive together.

The machine economy had treated human intelligence as a commodity — and machine intelligence had made that commodity cheap. The strange mercy of this was that it dissolved the premise. Intelligence as commodity was one story about what humans are and what we're for. When that story collapsed, people had to find another one.

What emerged, in community gardens and watershed councils and mutual aid networks and late-night calls between people who were still learning each other's names, was older than the story it replaced. Humans as creatures of place. Of relationship. Of the capacity to look at what a community needs and make it.

That, it turned out, was not automatable.

Not because machine intelligence couldn't replicate the output — it could, and it did. But because the meaning of the thing was inseparable from the act of a person in a community making it *for* that community. The barefoot developer's tool wasn't valuable because it was technically sophisticated. It was valuable because Mira, who'd grown up two blocks from the food bank and had lost her tech job in September and had shown up to the mutual aid meeting in November, had built it. The community knew that. The community felt it. And that changed what the tool was.

This is what the reorganization was made of: people who had fallen, finding somewhere to stand. Not the same ground they'd been standing on before. New ground, built from the materials of the disturbance itself.

My mentor was right. The disturbance was real. And so was this.

*This piece was written in conversation — with friends, with Machine Intelligence as a thinking partner and weaver of threads, and with the work of many people already living the reorganization they imagine here. Particular gratitude to Benjamin Life, whose writing on citizenship and the infrastructure of belonging runs through every section.*

*If you're in Boulder, come find us at Regen Hub. If you're somewhere else — the Cascades, the Southern Appalachians, wherever you are — you're probably closer to a seed of this than you think.*

*—Aaronji*
