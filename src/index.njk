  <p class="section-title">Who I Am</p>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>I'm Aaron G. I'm a dancer, a builder, a communicator. I love living and I love connecting, and I feel inspired to live as fully as I can.</p>
    <p>I was born to two amazing parents, Joe and Becky. They gave me a beautiful life and a beautiful foundation. I've lost both of them to cancer, and so that in many ways motivates me to live for all of us. I feel like I carry three lives in one body.</p>
    <p>My dad Joe gave me the word <em>Unforced</em>. He was a Tai Ji teacher and a builder of houses — a man with a great eye for angles and aesthetics and for living well. He wrote a book called <em><a href="/joe/">Too Much Fun Dying to Stop Now</a></em> while living with terminal brain cancer, and in it he pointed again and again to this way of being: that things unfold in their own time, unforced. My mom Becky was a math teacher and a deep lover of the earth and of gardens. I am very much their son. <a href="/writing/happy-birthday-joe/">More about Joe →</a></p>
    <p>I live in Boulder, Colorado. The mountains are my home now, though my roots stretch back through Ohio and Oregon — college towns, academic spaces, places where curiosity is welcome. I have a background in computer science from Case Western, a master's in Ecopsychology from Naropa, and I'm finishing a master's in Creative Technology & Design at CU Boulder.</p>

  <p class="section-title">What Unforced Means</p>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>Unforced is about being in harmony with life and with nature. It's about listening to the way nature moves and attuning to that. It's about recognizing that we're a part of nature — so when we harmonize ourselves with nature, we're also listening to our own nature.</p>
    <p>Unforced is about understanding who we are so that we can be our natural expression. It's not about being passive and just letting it all happen. The Taoists call it <em>wu-wei</em> — not forcing.</p>
    <p>I learned unforced from my dad, Joe. In his book, he wrote: "With interaction, all possibilities open in a unique way that allows for creative energy to flow naturally, unforced, in all directions simultaneously."</p>
    <p>What I've come to understand is that this isn't just a personal philosophy — it's how living systems actually work. Self-organizing networks don't push the river. Life unfolds through relationship, through connection, through participating with what's already moving. When we stop forcing, we start belonging. <a href="/writing/weaving-wu-wei/">Deeper exploration →</a></p>

      <h3>Parachute</h3>
      <p>Parachute exists because our thinking is fragmented. The fragmentation in our tools is affecting the fragmentation in our thinking. I've spent ten years searching for a tool that actually helps me think — and now I'm building it. Parachute is open, local-first, voice-first extended mind technology. A connected tool for connected thinking.</p>

      <h3>Woven Web</h3>
      <p>Woven Web exists because we need to find new ways of being together. It's a communal learning lab exploring what it means to be alive together — holding deep curiosity in consciousness, connectedness, and communication. We don't claim to have the answers. We're finding them together. <a href="https://wovenweb.org">wovenweb.org →</a></p>

      <h3>Learn Vibe Build</h3>
      <p>A cohort-based program teaching people to create using AI as a collaborator. Not a bootcamp or tutorial — a structured container where participants learn together, build alongside each other, and bridge the gap between vision and creation. Currently running our first cohort, flowing into ETHBoulder in February. <a href="https://learnvibe.build">learnvibe.build →</a></p>

      <h3>Tai Ji</h3>
      <p>I'm a student of Tai Ji, and occasionally a teacher of it. This practice is about listening, opening, and exploring — the interwoven dance of opposites. It connects me to embodiment and flow, and to my dad who first taught me to move this way. I study with Chungliang Al Huang and practice with my stepmom Laurie, continuing a lineage of movement and presence. <a href="/writing/practicing-unforced/">Practicing Unforced →</a></p>
