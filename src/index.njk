   Section 2: Who I Am

<section id="who">
  <p class="section-title">Who I Am</p>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>I'm Aaron G. I'm a dancer, a builder, a communicator. I love living and I love connecting, and I feel inspired to live as fully as I can.</p>

    <p>I was born to two amazing parents, Joe and Becky. They gave me a beautiful life and a beautiful foundation. I've lost both of them to cancer, and so that in many ways motivates me to live for all of us. I feel like I carry three lives in one body.</p>

    <p>My dad Joe gave me the word <em>Unforced</em>. He was a Tai Ji teacher and a builder of houses — a man with a great eye for angles and aesthetics and for living well. He wrote a book called <em>Too Much Fun Dying to Stop Now</em> while living with terminal brain cancer, and in it he pointed again and again to this way of being: that things unfold in their own time, unforced. My mom Becky was a math teacher and a deep lover of the earth and of gardens. I am very much their son. <a href="https://unforced.substack.com/p/happy-birthday-joe">More about Joe →</a></p>

    <p>I live in Boulder, Colorado. The mountains are my home now, though my roots stretch back through Ohio and Oregon — college towns, academic spaces, places where curiosity is welcome. I have a background in computer science from Case Western, a master's in Ecopsychology from Naropa, and I'm finishing a master's in Creative Technology & Design at CU Boulder.</p>

    <p>A bit about my name: Aaron means "mountain of strength" and Gabriel means "God is my strength." I also carry a connection to eastern traditions through the name Hanuran Surya — "joyous breath shining like the sun." I sometimes think of Aaron as "Air-In," emphasizing my connection to the breath. These symbols connect me to myself and to the world around me.</p>

   Section 3: What Unforced Means
   ======================================== #}

<section id="unforced">
  <p class="section-title">What Unforced Means</p>
  <div class="prose">
    <p>Unforced is about being in harmony with life and with nature. It's about listening to the way nature moves and attuning to that. It's about recognizing that we're a part of nature — so when we harmonize ourselves with nature, we're also listening to our own nature.</p>

    <p>Unforced is about understanding who we are so that we can be our natural expression. It's not about being passive and just letting it all happen. The Taoists call it <em>wu-wei</em> — not forcing.</p>

    <p>My dad lived it. He met cancer, met death, met each day with a kind of radical acceptance and presence. As he wrote: "With interaction all possibilities open in a unique way that allows for creative energy to flow naturally, unforced, in all directions simultaneously..."</p>

    <p>What I've come to understand is that this isn't just a personal philosophy — it's how living systems actually work. Self-organizing networks don't push the river. Life unfolds through relationship, through connection, through participating with what's already moving. When we stop forcing, we start belonging. <a href="https://unforced.substack.com/p/weaving-wu-wei">Deeper exploration →</a></p>

    <article class="project">
      <h3 class="project__name">Parachute</h3>
      <p class="project__description">Parachute exists because our thinking is fragmented. The fragmentation in our tools is affecting the fragmentation in our thinking. I've spent ten years searching for a tool that actually helps me think — and now I'm building it. Parachute is open, local-first, voice-first extended mind technology. A connected tool for connected thinking.</p>

    <article class="project">
      <h3 class="project__name">Woven Web</h3>
      <p class="project__description">Woven Web exists because we need to find new ways of being together. It's a communal learning lab exploring what it means to be alive together — holding deep curiosity in consciousness, connectedness, and communication. We don't claim to have the answers. We're finding them together.</p>

    <article class="project">
      <h3 class="project__name">What Technology Can Be</h3>
      <p class="project__description">A media project exploring a different relationship with technology — looking at new technologies that actually contribute to living a more balanced life. It's about recognizing that technology emerges from our human aliveness and can enrich our experience when we understand it as part of who we are.</p>

      <h3 class="project__name">Tai Ji</h3>
      <p class="project__description">I'm a student of Tai Ji, and occasionally a teacher of it. This practice connects me to embodiment and flow, and to my dad who first taught me to dance this way. I study with Chungliang Al Huang and practice with my stepmom Laurie, continuing a lineage of movement and presence.</p>
