# Drafts

Writing in progress — not published to the website.

These files live in the repo and can be shared via GitHub links, but Eleventy
never builds them since this folder is outside `src/`.

When a draft is ready to publish, move it to `src/writing/` and remove `draft: true`
from the frontmatter (if present).
